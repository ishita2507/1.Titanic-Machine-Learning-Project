Steps for Project Planning 
1. Understand what type of problem it is - Regression, Classfication, etc
2. Understand the nature of the data
      .info(), .describe() ---- it means to understand what are the data types, numerics or categories, understand avg or missing values 
3. Exploring Numerics: 
      Histograms and Boxplots  --- helps to understand the trends in the data and understand does any column require us to dive into further?
4. Exploring Measures: 
      Value Counts --- Since for categorical we can't do Histograms or Box plots, therefore, we do bar chats to see what categories people fall for 
5. Missing Data: 
      Understand the missing values to see if we want to remove the missing values or impute the data 
6. Correlation between the metrics 
      Now, you have understood the columns individually, it's time to explore in correlation between the different metrics to see what things are related and which things
      are related to dependent variables 
7. Classification/Regression Problem: Since we are predicting yes or no based on factors so it is a classification problem
8. Explore other things in the data 
      #Did Wealthy survive?
      #By cabin affected the survival rate?
      #Ticket price affected the survival rate?
9. Feature Engineering 
      Make some new variables 
10. Preprocess data together or use a transformer 
      Pre-process the data so we can use it in the analysis in our models
      #use label for train and test 
11. Model Building 
      Scaling?
      Model Baseline 
      #Model comparison with CV
