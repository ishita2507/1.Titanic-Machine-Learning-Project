# 1.Titanic-Machine-Learning-Project
Kaggle Project: A predictive machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck

**Context:**
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this project, I build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

**Strategy Used:** 
1. Understand the problem (Always learn about the data)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Better EDA better results -- try different methods to see if results improve!) 
3. Train, tune, ensemble (combining multiple models) Machine learning projects
4. Accuracy test of your model
